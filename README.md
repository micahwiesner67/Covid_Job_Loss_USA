# Covid_Job_Loss_USA
We examined the loss of jobs due to Covid-19 by county, state, region, and job sector. We qualitatively tested the hypothesis that job loss was dependent upon population.

Analysis is still a work in progress as of June, 2020. 

<b>Questions:</b> 
1. Was job loss due to Covid-19 statistically worse in one region of the country vs another?
2. Which sector did job loss due to Covid-19 affect most?
3. Correcting for population, were rural or urban regions hit harder economically by Covid-19?
